# Pigs_shell_git
Developing a git-like distributed version control program
Your task in this assignment is to implement Pigs, a subset of the version control system Git.

Git is a very complex program that has many individual commands. You will implement only a few of the most important commands. You will also be given a number of simplifying assumptions, which make your task easier.

Pigs stands for POSIX Implementation of Git in Shell.

As you must implement Pigs in POSIX Shell (dash).
